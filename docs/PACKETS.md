# PACKETS — active queue + history

A packet is the unit of safe work: small enough that one agent understands every
touched file and a reviewer can read the diff. Spec the done-when and allowed-files
BEFORE editing, so divergence is caught at plan time, not screenshot time.

Schema: `id · objective · allowed_files · forbidden · invariants · test_plan ·
done_when · rollback`.

## ACTIVE

### P-66 — Unify movement inputs + interactions on the walkable place
**Status:** P-66a ✅ done · P-66b ✅ done · P-66c ⏸ deferred (deliberate version-bump pass).
Suite 6,934 green; live-verified (compass/text/click all move one token; clicking
Corwin opened the existing dialogue). P-66c deferred ON PURPOSE: persisting position
in the world + retiring `scene.interior` touches WORLD_VERSION + `ensureWorld` + the
determinism suite — high-risk/low-visible, so it gets its own careful pass (inv #8,
#11) rather than being rushed. Position currently persists in `ui.place` across
re-renders but resets on reload/resume; that's acceptable until P-66c.
**Why:** The local map is now one continuous walkable place (click-to-walk, wall/door
collision, fog — `placeNav.js`, `NAV1`, live-verified). But two gaps remain before it's
the *whole* loop: text/compass still drive the engine's legacy node/interior movement
(two movement systems), and walking past an NPC/building does nothing (no interactions).

**Objective:** Make text + compass + click all move the SAME token, and make reaching
an NPC or building interactable — so the unified scale is the only way you move and act.

**Sub-packets (do in order, each ships green + verified):**
- **P-66a — Compass/text nudge the token.** The N/W/E/S buttons and "go north"/"walk
  …" text move the walkable token (via `walkTo`), not the engine's node/interior
  compass, while standing in a place. Inter-village travel stays explicit (region Map
  tab / walking to the place edge — define which).
  - allowed: `public/v1.js`, `public/map/placeNav.js` (+ a small intent shim if needed)
  - done_when: typing "go north" and clicking both move the same `@`; suite green; no `worldHash` change (movement is client position).
- **P-66b — Interact by reaching.** Walking adjacent to an NPC token offers talk
  (routes to engine `playerMove("talk to X")`); reaching an enemy starts combat;
  reaching loot picks up. Click-on-token also works (parity with text).
  - allowed: `public/v1.js`, `public/map/handDrawnPlace.js` (hitboxes), `public/map/placeFromNode.js`
  - done_when: reaching/clicking an NPC opens the existing dialogue; an enemy starts the existing combat; suite green.
- **P-66c — Persist position + retire the interior "mode".** Player position saved with
  the world; `scene.interior` no longer drives a separate local view (the start is just
  the token in the cottage bedroom on the one place).
  - allowed: `engine/state.js` (persist pos field + normalizer), `engine/playloop.js` (begin), `public/v1.js`
  - invariants: new persisted field MUST be added to `ensureWorld` (inv #8); WORLD_VERSION bump if shape changes (inv #11); replay stays stable.
  - done_when: save/resume keeps your position; determinism suite green; `playtest:quick` clean.

**Global invariants for P-66:** §13 one walkable scale, §6 narration≠canon, §1–2
determinism. Movement is client position; anything that changes canon (talk, fight,
travel, time) still routes through `playerMove`/`applyDeltas`.

**Forbidden:** rewriting the engine's combat/dialogue; broad refactor; `Math.random`;
breaking the determinism suite; touching the prototype (`__preview/`).

**Rollback:** each sub-packet is a small diff in `public/` (P-66a/b) or one guarded
engine field (P-66c) — revert the named files.

## DONE (recent)
- **Living-World Merge P1–P6** (`docs/LIVING_WORLD_MERGE.md`): biomes, biome encounters,
  living ecology, NPC wants/discovery, hidden Will in casting, open-ended (no win).
- **Intent layer** (`engine/intent/`, IN1–IN4): text + click + voice → one intent.
- **Bedroom start** — wake in a cottage bedchamber in a safe village (forced home cottage).
- **Authored interiors in v1** — `drawInteriorV2` renders the plan catalog, not the stub.
- **Continuous exterior place** — replaced the tile overworld; real village from the node.
- **Walkable place + collision** — `placeNav.js` (NAV1); click-to-walk, walls, doors, fog.
- Prose/seam red-team: combat narration, dialogue ejection, "No one to fight",
  dungeon→neutral wording, SIGNATURE placeholder, motif duplication.
