## 2026-06-18 — Codex

- Packet/seam: Rung 1 / H-1 scene-object action misrouted as strike
- Commit: `202ba1f`
- Files changed:
  - `engine/playloop.js`
  - `tests/U149.naturalAttackVerbs.test.js`
- Summary: Active escape-combat door/scene-object actions no longer default into enemy strike resolution.
- Proof:
  - `node --test tests/U149.naturalAttackVerbs.test.js`
  - `node --test tests/U149.naturalAttackVerbs.test.js tests/U151.grapple.test.js tests/U152.grappleIntegration.test.js tests/U170.combatStateNarration.test.js`
- Remaining Rung 1 seams:
  - H-2 narration inversion on grapple clinch
  - H-3/H-4/H-5 unarmed/natural attacks resolving as Worn Blade prose/profile
  - H-6 lethal grab/neck-snap intent routing to grapple clinch
- Rollback: revert commit `202ba1f`

## 2026-06-18 — Codex

- Packet/seam: Rung 1 / H-3/H-4/H-5 natural strikes surfacing as Worn Blade
- Commit: `7914ab3`
- Files changed:
  - `engine/combat/escapeCombat.js`
  - `tests/U149.naturalAttackVerbs.test.js`
- Summary: Active escape-combat natural/unarmed strike intents such as stomp now use a natural strike surface label instead of Worn Blade, without changing damage math.
- Proof:
  - `node --test tests/U149.naturalAttackVerbs.test.js`
  - `node --test tests/U149.naturalAttackVerbs.test.js tests/U167.strikeMechanicsDice.test.js tests/U170.combatStateNarration.test.js tests/U151.grapple.test.js tests/U152.grappleIntegration.test.js`
- Remaining Rung 1 seams:
  - H-2 narration inversion on grapple clinch
  - H-4/H-5 should be explicitly pinned if needed with headbutt/bite regressions
  - H-6 lethal grab/neck-snap intent routing to grapple clinch
- Rollback: revert commit `7914ab3`

## 2026-06-18 — Codex

- Packet/seam: Rung 1 / H-4/H-5 headbutt and bite natural strike coverage
- Commit: `93758b1`
- Files changed:
  - `tests/U149.naturalAttackVerbs.test.js`
- Summary: Added explicit regressions proving active-combat headbutt and bite no longer surface as Worn Blade after the naturalStrikeProfile fix.
- Proof:
  - `node --test tests/U149.naturalAttackVerbs.test.js`
- Remaining Rung 1 seams:
  - H-2 narration inversion on grapple clinch
  - H-6 lethal grab/neck-snap intent routing to grapple clinch
- Rollback: revert commit `93758b1`

## 2026-06-18 — Codex

- Packet/seam: Rung 1 / H-2 grapple clinch output contradicted saved state
- Commit: `caae8a5`
- Files changed:
  - `engine/combat/escapeCombat.js`
  - `tests/U152.grappleIntegration.test.js`
- Summary: Fixed deterministic grapple output/state alignment: enemy break-free text now corresponds to persisted enemy state, and active choke exchanges do not grant a separate immediate break-free roll that resets choke progress.
- Proof:
  - `node --test tests/U152.grappleIntegration.test.js`
  - `node --test tests/U151.grapple.test.js tests/U152.grappleIntegration.test.js tests/U170.combatStateNarration.test.js tests/U149.naturalAttackVerbs.test.js tests/U167.strikeMechanicsDice.test.js`
- Remaining Rung 1 seams:
  - H-6 lethal grab/neck-snap intent routing to grapple clinch
- Rollback: revert commit `caae8a5`

## 2026-06-18 — Codex

- Packet/seam: Rung 1 / H-6 lethal neck-snap intent routed to ordinary grapple
- Commit: `056e249`
- Files changed:
  - `engine/combat/grapple.js`
  - `tests/U151.grapple.test.js`
- Summary: Added a classification boundary so lethal head/neck twist-snap language no longer returns ordinary "grapple" from parseGrappleVerb(). This does not implement neck-snap mechanics, instant kill, HP damage, or a new "lethal" action.
- Proof:
  - `node --test tests/U151.grapple.test.js tests/U152.grappleIntegration.test.js`
- Remaining Rung 1 seams:
  - Run the Opus/Rung 1 gate again to discover any remaining live-output failures.
  - Decide later, in a separate design packet, how lethal close-quarters intent should resolve mechanically.
- Rollback: revert commit `056e249`
